# Drug-Classification-by-patients-response

In this project, I used decison tree classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients,
their response to different medications and predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug (one of 
5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y) that each patient responded to.

A little Headsup about Decision Trees is also commented at the top of the notebook.
